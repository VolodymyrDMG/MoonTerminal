//! Shared hotkey recognition and backend action execution for group windows, detached chart
//! windows, and the trade window — which routes only the window-local scale and super-zoom slots
//! through its own filter. Key matching previously lived in scattered `pressed()` checks under
//! `Shell::on_hotkey`, leaving some configured bindings inactive and detached chart windows with
//! no handling. The shared flow is now:
//!
//! - [`resolve`] maps a key-down event plus configuration to a semantic [`HotkeyAction`], comparing
//!   only `modifiers` and `key` rather than full `Keystroke` equality;
//! - [`apply`] executes shared backend actions against the caller-supplied active core and chart
//!   market. Actions requiring caller-level context return `false`: scale belongs to the calling
//!   window; cursor placement and cancellation follow the globally tracked hovered chart;
//!   switching and active-chart closing are group-local; reset and close-all are application-global.
//!
//! Configured shortcuts use GPUI's `Keystroke::parse` syntax. Shipped keyboard defaults are
//! Moonbot's own keys, read off its Hotkeys page — mostly `alt-`, with `ctrl-` where Moonbot uses it
//! and for the Terminal's own drawing tools, which Moonbot has no equivalent of. The literal
//! modifier is used on both Windows and macOS, as Moonbot does; bindings that need no modifier keep
//! their bare function-key or Delete forms.

/// reports the key handled and `translate_accelerator` skips the `TranslateMessage` that would
/// have produced it. Typing a coin name into the search box armed a drawing tool and swallowed the
/// letter; that is the whole bug.
///
/// `key_char` is the test, because it is the platform's own answer to "did this press produce a
/// character" — layout, dead keys and IME included, which no list of key names could track. Tab is
/// named on top of it for Windows, which reports no character for Tab where macOS reports `\t`;
/// both hand it to the form. Enter is the same split and is deliberately left alone: macOS calls it
/// a character, Windows does not, and no shipped binding sits on it either way.
///
/// The modifier cut is the deliberate half. Ctrl, Alt or Cmd usually means no character at all —
/// Windows drops control characters and routes an Alt press as `WM_SYSKEYDOWN`, which reaches no
/// input handler — but not always: macOS reports a character for Option combinations, and Windows
/// does for AltGr, which arrives as control plus alt. Those presses are still left to their
/// bindings, because most of the shipped keymap is `alt-` (`moon_core::config::HotkeysConfig`) and

/// Option is how you press them. A binding wins there; a user who needs the character rebinds.
