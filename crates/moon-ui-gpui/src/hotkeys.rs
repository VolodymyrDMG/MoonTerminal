//! Shared hotkey recognition and backend action execution for group windows and detached chart
//! windows. Key matching previously lived in scattered `pressed()` checks under
//! `Shell::on_hotkey`, leaving some configured bindings inactive and detached chart windows with
//! no handling. The shared flow is now:
//!
//! - [`resolve`] maps a key-down event plus configuration to a semantic [`HotkeyAction`], comparing
//!   only `modifiers` and `key` rather than full `Keystroke` equality;
//! - [`apply`] executes shared backend actions against the caller-supplied active core and chart
//!   market. Actions requiring caller-level context return `false`: scale belongs to the calling
//!   window; cursor placement and cancellation follow the globally tracked hovered chart;
//!   switching and active-chart closing are group-local; reset and close-all are application-global.
//!
//! Configured shortcuts use GPUI's `Keystroke::parse` syntax. Shipped keyboard defaults are
//! Moonbot's own keys, read off its Hotkeys page — mostly `alt-`, with `ctrl-` where Moonbot uses it
//! and for the Terminal's own drawing tools, which Moonbot has no equivalent of. The literal
//! modifier is used on both Windows and macOS, as Moonbot does; bindings that need no modifier keep
//! their bare function-key or Delete forms.
