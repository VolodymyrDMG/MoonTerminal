//! Native `gpu_canvas` chart renderer replacing wgpu offscreen rendering and readback. Own-pass
//! layers follow data semantics: Combo for market history, OrderBook for a snapshot, UserData for
//! mutable user state, chrome for Grid and Background, plus native cursor and readout. GPUI renders
//! static axis text.
//!
//! Chart domain behavior lives HERE in the terminal; the GPUI fork exposes only the generic
//! `RawGpuAccess` hook. Each layer has its own file. This module contains the `ChartEngine`
//! orchestrator: per-pane data preparation WITHOUT rendering plus the `gpu_canvas` element that
//! draws inside the GPUI frame.
