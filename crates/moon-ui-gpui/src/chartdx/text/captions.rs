//! Laying the configured captions out around one pane's plot and drawing them.
//!
//! The layout rule, stated once because two spellings of it drift: a row's ALIGNMENT owns the
//! direction it fills. A left-aligned row lays its captions out from the left edge rightwards, a
//! right-aligned one from the right edge leftwards, and a centred one is measured first and then
//! centred. The FIRST caption of a row is therefore the outermost one either way — "first" would
//! otherwise mean opposite things on opposite sides of the same chart.
//!
//! A pane is two columns, and the bands follow that: `ChartTop`/`ChartBottom` are edges of the
//! PLOT, while `ZoneTop`/`ZoneBottom` live in the CONTROL ZONE down the right side. The zone is
//! reserved whether or not an order book is drawn — [`super::caption::book_zone_left`] falls back
//! to a book-sized strip — which is why the chart still captions there with the book switched off.
//!
//! Everything a band holds is drawn INSIDE that band. The control strip measures its rows against
//! its own width; the plot's bands measure against the plot. The old caption hung its second line
//! off the strip's left edge, out over the candles — that is gone: WHICH caption ended up out there
//! depended on its position in the list, so "I chose the strip and it drew on the chart" was the
//! honest reading of it.
//!
//! A zone holding a band that WRAPS also divides its width rather than handing all of it to each
//! band in turn: the bands printing figures are drawn first, and the wrapping one is drawn last,
//! into what they left. A COLUMN — strategy-filter skip lines, the venue roster — is drawn between
//! those two: a line of it yields to figures that share its Y, and spends the rest of the zone
//! once those figures have ended, rather than wrapping at half the plot beside empty candles. See
//! [`widths`]. Before the wrap split,
//! a long detect line printed straight through whatever was pinned to the left and the right of it.
//! Two different zones are never divided against each other — each stays inside its own band, which
//! is the paragraph above.
