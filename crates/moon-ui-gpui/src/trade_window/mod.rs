//! A dedicated window showing ONE closed trade in its market context.
//!
//! # What it answers
//!
//! Clicking a closed trade in the Report used to move the MAIN chart's viewport onto the trade's
//! interval and fetch nothing, so the entry and exit arrows regularly landed over empty space and
//! the user's own chart was dragged away from whatever they were watching. This window answers the
//! question that gesture was really asking — "show me this trade" — without touching the main
//! chart at all: it fetches the market around the trade from the exchange's public REST and draws
//! it here, beside the trade's own figures.
//!
//! # How the frozen data reaches the chart
//!
//! The window owns its own [`ChartPanel`], and therefore its own chart engine. That engine is
//! handed a `moon_core::market::trade_replay::TradeReplaySeries` and reads from it INSTEAD of the
//! live market source. Because the override lives on the engine rather than in any registry, a
//! replay is structurally incapable of reaching the user's main chart: that engine holds `None`
//! and there is no shared key the two could collide on.
//!
//! # Why a whole `ChartPanel` and not a bare engine
//!
//! The engine draws pixels; everything AROUND them — theme and settings application, scene
//! visibility, sizing, wheel and hover input, and crucially the userdata pass that turns closed
//! trades into the entry/exit arrows — lives in `ChartPanel`. Hosting a bare engine here would
//! mean either a window with no arrows and no crosshair, or a second copy of that machinery, which
//! is exactly the parallel mechanism this project forbids.
//!
//! # Window ownership and dismissal
//!
//! The root owns the focus handle because Escape is a window command, not a chart command: a bare
//! Escape closes this independent window even after the chart takes focus, while modified Escape
//! stays available to the chart's own hotkey layer. The header mounts the frame's close control as
//! the visible dismissal affordance; the key is the fallback for a taskbar-hidden window whose
//! chrome cannot be reached.
