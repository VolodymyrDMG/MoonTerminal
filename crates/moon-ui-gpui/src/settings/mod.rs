//! Settings window, ported from egui's `src/settings/*` and `window/settings_window.rs`.
//! The separate OS window gives draft-backed tabs a live `Backend.preview`; closing the window
//! discards unsaved changes, while the Storage tab applies its separately persisted settings
//! immediately.
//! Save writes to disk through `AppConfig::save`; the shared daily scheduler independently owns
//! recovery copies in `backups/settings/`.
//!
//! The window is split into tabs like the egui original. This module owns the `SettingsView`
//! state and `open`; tab state and `impl SettingsView` blocks live in submodules. [`render`] owns
//! the tab bar, header, body, and Save footer, [`apply`] owns persistence and activation, and
//! [`common`] provides the shared UI and draft-binding helpers re-exported below.
