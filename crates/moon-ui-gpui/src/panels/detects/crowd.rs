//!
//! Everything a detection that no core reported needs, and nothing the rest of the feed needs. It
//! is here rather than in the middle of the panel because the two sources answer different
//! questions: a core's detection arrives with a strategy, a market and a server colour, and this
//! one arrives with a coin, a minute and two figures.
//!
//! Such a card also STANDS DOWN when a core has already reported the same coin, on any exchange:
//! the two would be one event reported twice, and the core's card is the one with a strategy and a
//! market behind it. That is decided at presentation (`rules::crowd_card_yields`) rather than at
//! ingest, so the crowd's card is there, ready, for the moment the core's own card expires.
//!
//! The market is the one thing such a card cannot supply itself, so it is BORROWED — from the first
//! core in this group that trades the coin, resolved exactly as clicking the ticker resolves it —
//! and everything that comes out of that one snapshot is shown: the chart, the venue, the exchange
//! kind and the price moves. Where that snapshot comes back empty the card carries its figures
//! alone rather than a chart frame and a `0.00%` measured from nothing. It is the FIRST core's
//! snapshot and not the best of them: a sibling with fuller history is not searched for, which
//! costs a chart on a coin the first one happens not to have charted — and buys one catalog walk
//! per crossing instead of one per core.
