//! Detachable detection-feed panel, ported from egui's `DetectRibbon`. It ingests group-core rows
//! for which `sound_alert || is_alert`. A row routed to a chart tab (`add_to_chart > 0`) is an
//! ordinary detect in every respect and joins the feed as well once `show_add_to_chart` is on;
//! while it is off, chart tabs show such rows alone, as they always did. Each `(core, market)` card
//! remains for `max(keep_alert_secs, 1)` seconds.
//! Left-click requests the market on Main without raising its window, while right-click requests a
//! custom comparison tab.
//!
//! The gear popup configures per-size dimensions, chart type, server rail, and field slots for each
//! group and persists them in `detects_view.toml`; see [`popup`]. Card layout and vector mini-charts
//! built from the snapshot captured at detection time live in [`cards`].
