//! Detachable detection-feed panel, ported from egui's `DetectRibbon`. It ingests group-core rows
//! for which `sound_alert || is_alert`. A row routed to a chart tab (`add_to_chart > 0`) is an
//! ordinary detect in every respect and joins the feed as well once `show_add_to_chart` is on;
//! while it is off, chart tabs show such rows alone, as they always did. Each `(core, market)` card
//! remains for `max(keep_alert_secs, 1)` seconds.
//! Left-click requests the market on Main without raising its window, while right-click requests a
//! custom comparison tab.
//!
//! **A second source, with no core behind it.** The crowd's rule (`crowd::service`) watches a
//! public statistics service and fires when one coin's rolling minute crosses both its lines. Such
//! a card has no core, no strategy and no server colour; what it does have besides the coin, the
//! money and the trades is BORROWED — the market of the first core in the group that trades the
//! coin lends it a chart, a venue and its price moves, and all of them are drawn. Both its clicks
//! open the coin the way every other bare ticker in the terminal opens: one core outright, several
//! through a picker. It is not scoped to a core, so no display preset can hide it: the crowd is not
//! one of this group's cores.
//!
//! The gear popup configures per-size dimensions, chart type, server rail, and field slots for each
//! group and persists them in `detects_view.toml`; see [`popup`]. Card layout and vector mini-charts
//! built from the snapshot captured at detection time live in [`cards`].

        // A COLUMN, not the Log panel's centred row, and the text carries its own definite width.
        // These sentences are whole clauses where `log.empty_filtered` is two words, so at a ~290px
        // side dock they have to WRAP — and a centred flex ROW cannot wrap them. GPUI measures text
        // with `wrap_width = known_dimensions.width.or(Definite(available))` (moon-gpui
        // `elements/text.rs:650`), so the min-content probe taffy runs to fix a row item's automatic
        // minimum width comes back with the whole one-line sentence: the item refuses to shrink,
        // overflows a narrow panel symmetrically under `justify_center`, and is clipped on BOTH
        // sides. `.text_center()` cannot save it — it centres lines inside a box already wider than
        // the panel. Giving the text `w_full` makes its width DEFINITE, which is the one input the
        // measure above needs; `max_w` then keeps a wide, undocked panel from stretching one clause
        // across the whole pane. Same shape as `analytics/render.rs`'s `quote_split_note`, and the
        // row-axis mirror of the rule pinned in `tests/theme_contract/shell.rs`.
