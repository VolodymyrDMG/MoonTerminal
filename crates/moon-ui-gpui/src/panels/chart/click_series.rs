//! Per-panel click counting, derived from the window-global native click count.
//!
//! The platform counts double clicks per WINDOW, from timing and cursor distance alone — see
//! `ClickState::update` in the GPUI fork's `moon-gpui-windows/src/window.rs`, which compares each
//! press against `GetDoubleClickTime` and `SM_CXDOUBLECLK` and never looks at which element was
//! hit. So a press landing on a chart can carry `click_count == 2` even though the FIRST press of
//! that pair went somewhere else entirely: the × that closed a chart, a sibling chart the stack
//! reflow has since moved away, or this slot before it took a new coin. Trading reads that count —
//! `LeftDouble` places an order by default — which turns closing charts one after another on the
//! same spot into an unrequested order on whatever slid under the cursor.
//!
//! This tracks the series one panel actually witnessed. A press extends the panel's own count
//! when it continues the press this panel saw last: same button, within the platform's own
//! double-click time, and no drag in between ([`ClickSeries::drag_beyond`]). FORK: deliberately
//! NOT within the platform's double-click distance and NOT bound to the native count — the
//! trader asked to open the pair with two clicks in DIFFERENT places, the order landing at the
//! second click. Both presses still have to land on THIS panel inside one double-click interval,
//! and a pan or line drag between them breaks the pair, so a stranger's press still cannot chain
//! onto a stale first click.
