//! Clicking an arbitrage venue's name: open THIS coin on THAT exchange.
//!
//! The column already answers "what does this coin cost elsewhere"; the obvious next question is
//! "show me". FORK: a left click opens the coin on the other exchange in its OWN WINDOW, while
//! Ctrl(Cmd)+left and the right click open it in a comparison tab beside the current chart; when
//! several cores are connected to that exchange the choice is a picker — the same shape the News
//! panel uses for the same problem.
//!
//! How a venue is matched to a core: an arbitrage platform code IS the core's platform ordinal for
//! an ordinary exchange (`ArbPlatformCode::from_exchange` is a byte copy), so the two compare
//! directly. A Hyperliquid deployer is the exception — every deployer shares the futures ordinal —
//! and is matched by its DEX name instead, which is the same name `known_dexes` gave the column.
