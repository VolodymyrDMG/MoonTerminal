//! Central `DockArea` chart panel with an own-pass GPU renderer and input handling. As a dock panel
//! it can be detached into a window. Main markets come from focus or `Backend::open_on_main` through
//! its atomic `open_main_request`, detection ingestion populates numbered AddToChart panels, and
//! manual selection or restoration populates numbered Custom panels.
//!
//! `ChartEngine.canvas()` supplies a GPUI `gpu_canvas` below the scene, rendering composed layers
//! directly into GPUI's backbuffer without readback; prepare updates the view and uploads new ticks.
//! Axis and readout text uses retained `gpu_canvas` text, while crosshair lines use the native
//! chartdx cursor layer.
//!
//! Responsibilities are split between state, lifecycle, constructors, and traits here; geometry and
//! hit-testing in [`geom`]; market refcounts and TTL/auto-live timers in [`refs`]; manual trading and
//! order dragging in [`trade`]; rendering in [`render`]; and slot wheel, mouse, and hover handling in
//! [`render_input`].
