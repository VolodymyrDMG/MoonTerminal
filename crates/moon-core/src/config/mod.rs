//! Primary server configuration split across two files below [`paths::data_dir`]:
//! - `servers.enc` in the data root (encrypted): uid/name/key as portable secrets; host, port, and
//!   transport are encoded in the Moonbot key itself;
//! - `cfg/settings.toml` (plaintext): schema version, groups, and per-server metadata such as
//!   active/show_window/feed flags, group, market, and color, joined to servers by uid.
//!
//! An older `settings.toml` without newer fields remains readable through serde defaults. A
//! `version` below `SCHEMA_VERSION` triggers one write that adds defaulted fields while retaining
//! existing values.
//!
//! Module responsibilities:
//! - `schema` defines the serde file structures and schema version;
//! - `store` reads and writes files, including encryption and damaged-settings backups;
//! - `reconcile` merges file data into runtime state and assigns stable uids;
//! - `migrate` performs one-time migrations from legacy formats;
//! - `backup` creates daily snapshots in `backups/settings/` and protects schema migrations;
//! - `uid_counter` requires every counter construction path to name the optional store floor.
