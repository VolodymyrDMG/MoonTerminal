//! Frozen market history for ONE closed trade, fetched from the exchange's public REST.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Clicking a closed trade in the Report used to reposition the main chart's viewport onto the
//! trade's interval and fetch nothing, so the entry and exit arrows regularly landed over empty
//! space. Neither of the two live sources can fix that: MoonProto keeps trades in a bounded
//! in-process ring rather than a history store, and a core answers `request_coin_card` with about
//! five hundred recent bars and accepts no time range. The exchange's own public REST is the only
//! thing that can answer "what was this market doing between 14:02 and 14:20 last Tuesday".
//!
//! # What a replay is, and what it is NOT
//!
//! A [`TradeReplaySeries`] is an IMMUTABLE, BOUNDED answer to one such question: the rows covering
//! one trade's window, already fetched, already clipped. It has no live edge, no subscription and
//! no incremental drain, and [`TradeReplaySeries::read_into`] is a PURE function of the series and
//! the requested window — no lock, no client, no I/O.
//!
//! It is deliberately NOT registered anywhere global. The consumer holds it directly on the chart
//! engine it owns, so a replay cannot reach the user's live main chart even by mistake: there is
//! no key to collide on. Contrast [`crate::fixture`], whose bench state is a process-wide
//! `OnceLock` — that module is the SHAPE this one copies, never a mechanism it reuses.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - [`venue_caps`] — which venues can be asked, and through which route. Keyed off
//!   [`crate::venue::Venue`], never off an exchange name.
//! - Everything a caller renders arrives as a TYPE ([`TradeReplayOutcome`]), never as a built
//!   sentence: `moon-core` has no `rust_i18n` and must not decide the user's wording.
