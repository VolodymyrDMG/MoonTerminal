//! What each venue's PUBLIC, UNAUTHENTICATED REST can serve for an ARBITRARY PAST window.
//!
//! The trade window replays one closed trade against the market around it, and the only source
//! that can answer for an arbitrary past window is the exchange itself: MoonProto keeps a bounded
//! live ring rather than history, and a core answers `request_coin_card` with ~500 recent bars and
//! no time range at all. So this module is the directory of what may be ASKED for, keyed off
//! [`crate::venue::Venue`] — never off an exchange name, for exactly the reason `venue.rs` states
//! in its own header: a name is a caption whose spelling belongs to the core build.
//!
//! Two rules govern every arm below, and both exist because the endpoints are public and
//! rate-limited per IP:
//!
//! - **An UNVERIFIED endpoint is [`None`], not an optimistic guess.** A capability table is
//!   precisely the place where "this probably works" must not be written down: a wrong arm spends
//!   the user's request budget on a 404 loop and can get their address limited. Every route named
//!   here was read off the vendor's own documentation.
//! - **A venue with no route degrades HONESTLY.** The window says which venue it cannot reach and
//!   offers no retry, because retrying cannot help. That is a supported outcome, not a failure —
//!   see [`super::TradeReplayEmpty::NoEndpoint`].
//!
//! Coverage is deliberately staged. This module ships the routes for Binance (spot, USD-M,
//! COIN-M), Bybit (spot, futures), Gate (spot, futures), BitGet (spot, futures), OKX (spot, swap)
//! and Hyperliquid (spot and perpetual share one shape).
//!
//! **HTX is the one brand left answering [`None`], and not for want of reading.** Its public spot
//! REST serves candles from `GET /market/history/kline`, which accepts `symbol`, `period` and
//! `size` and nothing else: there is no time range, no cursor and no anchor, so the only window it
//! can answer for is the most recent `size` minutes counted from NOW. Appending `from`/`to`
//! anyway returns HTTP 200 and a byte-identical body, which means a caller cannot even tell that
//! its window was discarded — the exact shape of failure this module's first rule exists to
//! forbid. A wrong answer here would not stay local either: [`super::worker`] merges fetched rows
//! into the kline cache the LIVE recorder shares, so recent bars filed as last Tuesday's history
//! would be read back by every other consumer of that table. [`None`] is the honest answer.
//!
//! # The directory, in one table
//!
//! Every column below was read off the vendor's own page or, where a vendor has withdrawn it,
//! MEASURED against the live endpoint. The market name is whatever the core reports, and it
//! already arrives in each venue's own spelling (`crate::symbol::Exchange`), so no route rewrites
//! one.

//!
//! The `order` column is DOCUMENTATION and nothing reads it: [`super::rest::fetch_klines`] sorts
//! every page ascending unconditionally, which also absorbs a vendor quietly changing direction.
//! It is recorded because a reader comparing this table against a vendor page needs it, not
//! because a branch depends on it.
//!
//! Two rows earn a second look. **BitGet spells the one-minute bar differently on its two
//! markets** — `1min` on spot and `1m` on futures — and the wrong one is an HTTP 400, so the token
//! belongs beside each fetch rather than in one shared constant. And **Hyperliquid cannot
//! distinguish an unknown coin from an outage**: both answer HTTP 500 with a body of literally
//! `null`, so its classifier calls every failure transient, which is the direction that caches
//! nothing.
//!
//! # The trade-route directory, in one table
//!
//! [`TradeRoute`] is the same idea one level down: which venues can answer a public "trades
//! between T1 and T2" question, for the trade-detail window's tick replay. Every row was read off
//! the vendor's own documentation, same discipline as the kline table above. Bybit, Hyperliquid
//! and HTX document no such endpoint reachable from this build, so [`trade_route`] answers
//! [`None`] for all three — the same honest degradation [`kline_route`] already gives HTX.

//! Two venue facts that are silently wrong when mistaken: **Binance futures (both arms) retain
//! only 48 hours of aggTrades**, so the retention check must run before any request is spent; and
//! **Gate's `from`/`to` are in SECONDS**, while every other timestamp in this module is
//! milliseconds.
//!
//! **Three trade routes report a CONTRACT count where `Tick::qty` is documented as base-currency
//! quantity**, and this is deliberate rather than an oversight: `OkxHistoryTrades`
//! (SWAP instruments only — `sz` is base currency for SPOT), `BinanceCoinMAggTrades` (`q` on a
//! dapi row, with no `baseQty` alternative), and `GateFuturesTrades` (`size`, whose base amount
//! depends on the contract's `quanto_multiplier`). No code compensates for this: the chart's
//! volume bars stay shape-correct because the drawn scale is window-relative and a per-instrument
//! multiplier is a constant that cancels out of it, and a tick series' aggregated candles never
//! reach the shared kline cache where an absolute figure could be read as genuine history. See
//! each route's own parser for the fact restated in the vendor's own terms.
