//! The one background thread that fetches trade replays, and the request protocol reaching it.
//!
//! # Why exactly one thread
//!
//! Not for throughput — for RESTRAINT. A user walking down a report opens rows faster than any of
//! these endpoints wants to be asked, and a thread per request would turn that into a burst that
//! spends the user's IP budget. One worker serialises every call, which is also the only thing
//! that makes [`super::gate::ReplayGate::pace`]'s floor a real process-wide floor rather than a
//! per-caller hope. `moon-core` has no async runtime, so this is a plain blocking thread and an
//! `mpsc` pair, exactly like the kline cache and the report valuation worker beside it.
//!
//! # Two caches, and both are load-bearing
//!
//! Bars go into the SHARED `klines.sqlite` under the real exchange key, because a one-minute bar
//! fetched here is indistinguishable from one the recorder wrote and the rest of the application
//! benefits from it. Whole OUTCOMES additionally go into a small in-memory ring owned by this
//! worker, keyed by the exact question asked. That second cache is what actually satisfies "the
//! second open of the same trade costs nothing": the SQLite cache cannot hold ticks at all, and
//! nothing else in the process remembers that a given window was already answered.
//!
//! # The degrade ladder
//!
//! A tick stage never throws away what it already paid for. Cancellation is the one thing that
//! discards everything collected so far, because the window itself is gone; every other stop —
//! the page or tick budget, the job deadline, a venue's own refusal — instead SERVES what was
//! already fetched and names the reason in [`TradeReplaySeries::tick_status`], rather than
//! abandoning the whole stage and falling back to bars with no explanation. Only a harvest that
//! ends up genuinely empty reaches the candles-only outcome, and even then the bar layer drawn is
//! never blank: [`TickStage::candles`] carries the exchange's own one-minute klines forward from
//! the candle stage that ran first, so the window always has SOMETHING to show while the reasoned
//! caption explains what is missing and why.

///
/// `fetch` is the injected seam — no network, no clock, no gate inside this function, which is
/// what makes it testable with a fake fetcher and a fake [`TickObserver`].
///
/// The loop rule, in order of precedence (D2-2, replacing this function's earlier design in
/// full):
/// - [`cancelled`] stops EVERYTHING, always, and discards whatever was collected — the window is
///   gone and there is no one left to serve it to.
/// - The job deadline and the page budget each stop the WALK without abandoning it, at any point:
///   the harvest collected so far is kept, and the loop moves straight to the verdict. This is
///   the whole point of this function's redesign — a budget or a deadline crossed an hour of lead
///   context away from the trade must never throw away the tiles around the trade that were
///   already paid for.
/// - A venue's own answer — `Transient`/`UnknownSymbol` — also stops the walk rather than the
///   whole stage, and marks the harvest [`TickHarvest::venue_refused`], so [`serve_ticks`] knows
///   not to clear a refusal the venue just gave it.
/// - The FOCUS tiles (the leading [`TickPlan::focus_len`] entries) are never truncated by the
///   tick budget: it is checked only around a NON-focus tile, before it starts and again once it
///   finishes, so a tile is walked whole or not at all — never cut mid-body.
/// - Every page is clipped to the SLICE it was fetched for before it is counted toward any budget
///   (D2-1): Binance's forward pager and OKX's backward one both routinely return a page that
///   overshoots its own slice edge, and [`Tick`] carries no exchange trade id, so an unclipped
///   overlap between two adjacent slices is undetectable once concatenated, not merely unnoticed.
///   The aggregate clip to [`TickHarvest::covered`] in [`serve_ticks`] is the OUTER bound and does
///   not replace this inner one.
/// - The verdict is one question: is the harvest empty? A non-empty one is always `Ready`,
///   whatever stopped the walk; only an empty one reaches [`TickVerdict::Abandoned`], carrying
///   whichever reason actually stopped it.
///
/// Args:
///     route: Which venue endpoint this stage answers.
///     plan: The window's own [`tick_plan`] output — tiles in fetch-priority order, with the
///         first [`TickPlan::focus_len`] of them being the trade's own focus.
///     tick_budget: Ceiling on the total ticks collected before a non-focus tile is skipped.
///     page_budget: Ceiling on the total pages fetched across every tile.
///     cancelled: Answers whether the requester's window has closed.
///     expired: Answers whether this stage's own deadline has passed.
///     observer: Records the `claim`/`pace` calls this stage makes.
///     fetch: Fetches one page for a given slice and cursor.
