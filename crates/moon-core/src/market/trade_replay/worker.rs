//! The one background thread that fetches trade replays, and the request protocol reaching it.
//!
//! # Why exactly one thread
//!
//! Not for throughput — for RESTRAINT. A user walking down a report opens rows faster than any of
//! these endpoints wants to be asked, and a thread per request would turn that into a burst that
//! spends the user's IP budget. One worker serialises every call, which is also the only thing
//! that makes [`super::gate::ReplayGate::pace`]'s floor a real process-wide floor rather than a
//! per-caller hope. `moon-core` has no async runtime, so this is a plain blocking thread and an
//! `mpsc` pair, exactly like the kline cache and the report valuation worker beside it.
//!
//! # Four caches, and each is load-bearing
//!
//! Bars go into the SHARED `klines.sqlite` under the real exchange key, because a one-minute bar
//! fetched here is indistinguishable from one the recorder wrote and the rest of the application
//! benefits from it. Whole OUTCOMES additionally go into a small in-memory ring owned by this
//! worker, keyed by the exact question asked. That second cache is what satisfies "the second
//! open of the SAME trade costs nothing": the kline cache cannot hold ticks at all, and nothing
//! else in the process remembers that a given window was already answered. The third is the tick
//! TILE store ([`super::tick_tiles`]), keyed by exchange and market and answering by COVERAGE
//! the way the bars are: it is what makes a NEIGHBOURING trade on the same market cost only the
//! stretch of its focus no earlier window fetched — and nothing at all when there is none. The
//! fourth is that store's disk, `trades.sqlite` ([`super::trade_cache`]): the tick stage hydrates
//! the tiles from it before deciding what to fetch and writes every harvest through, so the
//! same question survives a restart — behind a switch in the Storage tab.
//!
//! # The degrade ladder
//!
//! A tick stage never throws away what it already paid for. Cancellation is the one thing that
//! discards everything collected so far, because the window itself is gone; every other stop —
//! the page or tick budget, the job deadline, a venue's own refusal — instead SERVES what was
//! already fetched and names the reason in [`TradeReplaySeries::tick_status`], rather than
//! abandoning the whole stage and falling back to bars with no explanation. Only a harvest that
//! ends up genuinely empty reaches the candles-only outcome, and even then the bar layer drawn is
//! never blank: [`TickStage::candles`] carries the exchange's own one-minute klines forward from
//! the candle stage that ran first, so the window always has SOMETHING to show while the reasoned
//! caption explains what is missing and why.

///   completes, normal limits apply immediately, before any optional margin is requested.
///   Hard stops retain the truthful partial harvest even if the entire trade could not fit.
/// - A venue's own answer — `Transient`/`UnknownSymbol` — also stops the walk rather than the
///   whole stage, and marks the harvest [`TickHarvest::venue_refused`], so [`serve_ticks`] knows
///   not to clear a refusal the venue just gave it.
/// - The FOCUS tiles (the leading [`TickPlan::focus_len`] entries) are never truncated by the
///   tick budget: it is checked only around a NON-focus tile, before it starts and again once it
///   finishes, so a tile is walked whole or not at all — never cut mid-body.
/// - Every page is clipped to the SLICE it was fetched for before it is counted toward any budget
///   (D2-1): Binance's forward pager and OKX's backward one both routinely return a page that
///   overshoots its own slice edge, and [`Tick`] carries no exchange trade id, so an unclipped
///   overlap between two adjacent slices is undetectable once concatenated, not merely unnoticed.
///   The aggregate clip to [`TickHarvest::covered`] in [`serve_ticks`] is the OUTER bound and does
///   not replace this inner one.
/// - The verdict is one question: is the harvest empty? A non-empty one is always `Ready`,
///   whatever stopped the walk; only an empty one reaches [`TickVerdict::Abandoned`], carrying
///   whichever reason actually stopped it.
///
/// Args:
///     route: Which venue endpoint this stage answers.
///     plan: The window's own [`tick_plan`] output — tiles in fetch-priority order, with the
///         first [`TickPlan::focus_len`] of them being the trade's own focus.
///     tick_budget: Ceiling on the total ticks collected before a non-focus tile is skipped.
///     page_budget: Normal page ceiling; trade tiles get at least [`TRADE_PAGE_BUDGET`].
///     cancelled: Answers whether the requester's window has closed.
///     expired: Answers whether the deadline has passed; `true` selects the hard trade deadline.
///     observer: Records the `claim`/`pace` calls this stage makes.

/// Args:

///     covered: The walk's own exhaustive stretches, carried onto the series verbatim — the
///         chart withholds the bars lying inside them, and only this coverage knows that a
///         covered minute with no trade in it is still covered.
