//! HTTP client and response parsers for the public replay endpoints.
//!
//! The client is built the same way the valuation provider builds its own — HTTPS-only, one
//! bounded global timeout, HTTP status returned rather than raised — because that shape is already
//! proven against these same vendors in this same process. What is deliberately NOT shared is the
//! code: the valuation provider asks a different question (one minute's rate for a conversion) and
//! its range arithmetic, its symbol routing and its failure vocabulary all answer that question.
//! Reusing its private types would couple the market layer to a report-valuation detail.
//!
//! # One module per venue, and why the file is not one file
//!
//! This module owns only what every venue shares: the client, the failure vocabulary, the two
//! cell readers, and the dispatch. Everything a VENDOR decides — its query grammar, its error
//! envelope, its row order, which cell holds base volume — lives in that vendor's own module
//! beside its route.
//!
//! That split is not filing tidiness. Each of these venues has at least one fact that is silently
//! wrong when mistaken rather than loudly wrong: Gate spot's cells are not in OHLC order, an OKX
//! swap's volume cell counts contracts, BitGet spells the one-minute bar differently on its two
//! markets, Hyperliquid cannot distinguish a bad symbol from an outage. Held in one shared
//! if-ladder, a correction aimed at one vendor sits one typo away from changing another's meaning.
//! Held per module, it cannot.
//!
//! Every parser here is PURE: it takes a decoded JSON value and returns bars or a classified
//! failure. That is deliberate — a parser is where a vendor's units, ordering and field names are
//! actually pinned, and a pure function is the only kind of parser a test can hold to those
//! without a network. It is also why the recorded fixtures beside each module are enough, and no
//! HTTP-mocking dependency is needed.
