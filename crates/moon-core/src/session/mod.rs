//! `SessionManager` runs one backend thread, or core, for each active configured server whose
//! group is active.
//!
//! Core data is split across two planes:
//! - the account plane (status, orders, detects, and strategies) is specific to each core and
//!   stored in `CoreStore` by `CoreId`;
//! - the market plane (price ticks and order books) is stored in `MarketStore` (see
//!   `crate::market`). In `Dedup` mode, cores on one exchange share a provider core; in `PerCore`
//!   mode, every core is its own provider.
//!
//! The coordinator (see `coordinator.rs`) learns each core's exchange from `Identity`, selects
//! providers according to the active mode, and assigns market roles with the `SetMarket` command.
