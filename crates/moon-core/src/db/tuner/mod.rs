//! The Analytics window's filter tuner, adapted from Analytics V3 (an Excel dashboard):
//! threshold what-if analysis for report market fields. It calculates the "Fact vs variants"
//! KPIs (a variant is a set of lower/upper ranges on entry fields) and a profit-distribution
//! histogram over QUANTILE buckets for the selected field. V3's fixed scale does not fit our
//! data: values are percentages with extreme outliers, while hvol/dvol are volumes. The source
//! is the same replica-and-legacy UNION used by `analytics`.
//!
//! Query and evaluation entry points that scan report periods belong on a background
//! executor; pure formatting and metadata helpers do not scan those periods.
