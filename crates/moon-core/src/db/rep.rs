//! Typed replica of the Orders report database (`moonproto::Event::Report`) in
//! the `orders_rep` table.
//!
//! The core supplies an append-only schema through `ReportEvent::Schema`.
//! Column names are stored lowercase to match the legacy names consumed by the
//! Report panel; SQLite itself is case-insensitive. The replication key is
//! `(core_uid, newrecid)`. The legacy `closed_sell_reports` table uses a different
//! `db_id`, is read-only, and is purged per core after the first complete typed sync.
//!
//! A core resumes from a durable checkpoint — `{epoch, next_from_rec_id}` — held in `app_meta`
//! under `rep_epoch_{core_uid}` / `rep_next_{core_uid}`. The checkpoint is written ONLY by the
//! transaction that applies an alive map, never by `SyncComplete`: catch-up advances by
//! `newRecID` and therefore cannot observe a soft-delete, restore, or retention removal of an
//! older row that happened while the terminal was offline. The alive map is what repairs that,
//! so a checkpoint stored before it would record the repair as done. Open rows below the
//! checkpoint are reconciled separately through `check_open_rows`.
