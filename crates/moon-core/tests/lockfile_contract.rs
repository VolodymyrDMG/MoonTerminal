//! Static contract on the committed `Cargo.lock`: the frozen third-party dependency set CI
//! trusts, and cargo-deny's `sources` gate (`deny.toml`) scans, must actually be what it claims
//! to be — present, pinned to git (never a local path), and drawn only from reviewed hosts.
//!
//! Deliberately textual, like `moonproto_feature_guard.rs` and `ci_gate_contract.rs` next to it:
//! the workspace declares no dev-dependencies, and a TOML parser is not worth becoming the first
//! one. `Cargo.lock`'s `[[package]]` blocks are blank-line separated with unindented `key =
//! "value"` lines — a format stable enough to walk by hand.
//!
//! What it does NOT catch, stated plainly rather than implied:
//!
//! - **The pinned revision itself.** MoonUI's `#<rev>` legitimately moves on every CI-driven
//!   `cargo update -p moon-gpui -p moon-gpui-platform -p moon-ui` refresh; asserting a fixed
//!   revision would make this file redden on every ordinary MoonUI advance.
//! - **A drifted lock nobody committed.** These assertions only run against whatever
//!   `Cargo.lock` is on disk; they cannot tell a stale-but-honest lock from a stale-and-silently-
//!   diverged one. That is `cargo fetch --locked`'s job in `build.yml`, run before anything here.
//! - **The sibling MoonUI override workflow.** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ("Локальная разработка")
//!   documents an ignored `.cargo/config.toml` at the workspace root that `[patch]`es the three
//!   MoonUI crates to a local checkout — which legitimately rewrites `Cargo.lock` with `path`
//!   entries for the duration of that work. CI never has that file, so the invariant below still
//!   holds there; a developer running with the override active would otherwise see this file
//!   redden for a reason that has nothing to do with a bad commit, so the lock-content checks
//!   return early when the override is active.
