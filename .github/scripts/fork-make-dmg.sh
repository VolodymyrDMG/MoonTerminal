# One deliberate change: `hdiutil create` receives an EXPLICIT -size. Its automatic scratch
# sizing undershot twice in a row on the freshly assembled bundle (runs #12/#13: "create failed
# — No space left on device" while df showed 39 GiB free, and the copy died INSIDE the mounted
# scratch volume at /Volumes/MoonTerminal/...). Sizing from `du` plus fixed headroom makes the
# scratch deterministic. On an upstream refresh: re-copy their script over this file and re-apply
# the block marked FORK below.
#
# Package the macOS release binaries into a UNIVERSAL MoonTerminal.app and a distributable .dmg.
# Runs on the macos-14 runner (native tools: sips, iconutil, codesign, hdiutil, lipo).
#
# Expects BOTH slices to be staged already: release.yml compiles them in a per-architecture matrix
# job and this job downloads the two artifacts into `stage/`. They are joined here so Apple Silicon
# and Intel Macs share one download.
#
# Disk was the scarce resource that shaped this script: `hdiutil` failed with "No space left on
# device" back when one job compiled both slices and then imaged them. The bundle is still
# assembled directly inside the DMG staging root (never built beside it and copied, which held two
# universal binaries at once) and every input is still deleted once consumed — cheap habits worth
# keeping on a runner whose disk a release build can still exhaust, even though this job now starts
# without a build tree.

MoonTerminal — Installation

Universal build: one app for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
Requires macOS 11 or newer.

1. Drag MoonTerminal.app into the Applications folder (alias next to it).
2. First launch: double-click the app, then open
   System Settings -> Privacy & Security and press "Open Anyway".
   macOS warns about an unidentified developer — this is expected
   (the build is ad-hoc signed, not notarized).
   On macOS 14 and older, right-click -> "Open" -> "Open" also works;
   macOS 15 (Sequoia) removed that shortcut.

Updating:
Drag the new version into Applications and confirm the replacement.
Your cores and settings are preserved — they live OUTSIDE the app, in
~/Library/Application Support/com.moonbot.moonterminal/.
